<p>Computer science is a field pursued by many students. As it is not only a field full of difficulties but also a field in which u get to have great game with coding and programming.
   For me computer science was a field with something quite different face which was beyond my imagination. But now I can say computer science is that field which not only requires hard work but also a gud kind of imagination.</p>
<p>I decide to become a computer science engineer in early months of 11th.I only had knowledge about the basics of computer science ,but became familier with it now. I have just started learning HTML by adding CSS in my dictionary.
   I still remember the first day of my computer science with blood rushing in my veins with full speed and great excitment inside my heart. all the nervousness ended after having the a seminar with H.O.D sir and by meeting new friends.
   Actually now i want to learn more languages as it makes your inner worm to go crazy to learn them.<br>Thank u.</p></ul></b>
